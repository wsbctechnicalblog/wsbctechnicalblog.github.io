Summary: How I learned to develop software like a bureaucrat?

We recently hosted an amazing online [DevOps Vancouver Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/devops-vancouver-bc-canada/events/301182207/) on May 28, 2024. Our presenter [Alex Bundarzic ... see authors for details](https://wsbctechnicalblog.github.io/pages/authors.html), agreed to present a session at short-notice.

The discussion "How I learned to develop software like a bureaucrat" highlighted the issue of fragile software systems due to interdependencies which cause systems to fail when changes are made. Alex suggests that despite their inefficiency, bureaucratic methods used in large organizations can offer insights into creating more stable and adaptable software systems. This session will present ways to alter the software development process to enhance system robustness and prepare for inevitable changes.
