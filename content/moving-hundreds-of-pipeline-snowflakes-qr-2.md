Summary: Summarising the main points of our 2nd generation app-type blueprint-based pipelines.

Quick Reference Posters help us foster collaboration, visualise and get across key points for specific topics. They also serve as handy cheat sheets :)

The quick reference poster introduces:

- Left-hand side, introduces our app-type specific starter template, which is the only part engineers have to copy-paste into their application repository to get started, as well as a list of optional parameters we can pass to the extended template.
- In the centre of the poster, is an extract from our universal artifact app-type specific continuous integration (CI) / build template, which optionally includes the continuous deployment (CD) template once done.
- On the right-hand side, is an extract from our universal artifact app-type specific continuous deployment (CD) / release template. Note the flow variable, which is a strategy we covered in [How to share variables amongst Azure Pipeline agents](/sharing-variables-amongst-agents.html)

Enjoy and remember that we crave candid feedback to sprinkle value over these artifacts!
