## Notes

- **Custom Vision** service has a model you can build and train for classification or object detection (class name, probability score, bounding box).
- **Computer Vision** detects faces, **Face Service** finds and recognizes similar faces.
- **Face Detection** helps detect and recognize people's faces.
- **Form Recognizer** service has a custom model users can train, or a pre-built receipt model trained to work with receipts.
- **Image Analysis** helps extract information from the images, tag them, and create descriptive image summary.
- **Image Classification** classifies objects based on their content to answer the "what is the image?" question.
- **Semantic Segmentation** classifies pixels that belong to objects (detects) and highlights the object boundaries.
