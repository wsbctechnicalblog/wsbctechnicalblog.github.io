Summary: Before you ask for anything, get clarity on the five WHYs!

I am working on my communication and collaboration skills. Although these posts will not be of a technical nature, they will benefit us all. I learn by doing and sharing and I love getting candid feedback from you, as well as from my manager and mentor.

In recent courses I learnt that the impact of communication is made up of 7% words, 38% tone, and 55% cues.

That is for interactive communication! For written communication we lose the cues, making the words and tone even more important.

# Communicating upwards to executive domain

Our leaders are typically driven by **goals**, focused on the **bottom line**, and push for progress at a **rapid** pace. If our communication and proposals are too complex, they quickly become overburdened with the complexities, and are more likely to become dismissive.

We must paint a picture of success, clearly describe the **WHY**, and **HOW** we will affect the goals and bottom line. Communicate your idea/plan/request directly and objectively - no fillers, no waffling, no noise, and no redundant nouns.

If you are a **dreamer** like I am, you must balance your **dream** with **reality** or be viewed as overly optimistic and disruptive. 

I created a basic template to help me document initiatives when I need stakeholder advice, buy-in, and support. I am encouraging my team to use the same template when they have an idea, or if I ask them to create a plan.

Hope the template will help you as well.

# Proposal Template

Here is the template I created.

- Slides 1 (cover), 2 (quotes), 9 (references), and 10 (Q&A) are intended for presentations.
- Slide 3: **PROBLEM TO SOLVE** - 
- Slide 4: **OVERVIEW** - 
- Slide 5: **BENEFITS** - 
- Slide 6: **PROBLEM TO SOLVE** - 
- Slide 7: **INNOVATION** - 
- Slide 8: **EXPECTED OUTCOME** - This is the most important part, which describes the outcome and value proposition in the following format:

```
    We want to <WHAT>.
        I recommend that <WHAT>. 
        There are several benefits:
        First, <CORE VALUE>. 
        Also, <OTHER VALUE>. 
        Finally, <OTHER VALUE>.
    Imagine, if <WHAT>, we will <VALUE>.
```
