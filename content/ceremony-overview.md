Summary: Taking a step back and digesting this week's storm of ceremony posts.

During this week we launched a tsunami of blog posts focused on our [Center of Enablement](/ceremony-center-of-enablement.html) (CoE), [Dojo](/dojo-events.html), [Townhall](../images/coming-soon.png), [Working Group](../ceremony-working-group.html), and [Community of Practice](/ceremony-community-of-practice.html) (CoP) ceremonies. Behind the scenes we also launched our first CoE to dogfood (evaluate our own stuff) guardrails, posters, and working agreements we created.

In this post I will answer some of the questions we received to date.

The overview image highlights that the heart of our ceremonies is the CoE providing vision, direction, and governance. It also serves as the steward and source of laser focused working groups, dojos, and community of practice ceremonies. For details on each of ceremonies, refer to:

# Frequently asked questions

![FAQ](../images/automation-lesson-1-5.png)

## Who creates the CoE?

Anyone can collaborate and initiate a [Center of Enablement](/ceremony-center-of-enablement.html) and any of its related ceremonies. Our directors and managers are the **stewards** to ensure we have buy-in and that each CoE provides vision, direction, and governance to the organization.

## Why is the CoE called Center of Enablement, not Excellence?

On one hand the term **Excellence** triggers the same alarm bells as **Best Practices**. More importantly our goal is to **enable** our common engineering stakeholders - therefore I LOVE our decision to pivot to **Enablement**. The CoE enables by providing vision, direction, and governance, as well as stewarding laser focused working groups, dojos, and community of practices.

## Why do we have guardrails?

Yes, the guardrails feel like we are ignoring the first value of the Agile manifesto: "_Individuals and interactions over processes and tools_." We decided to introduce lightweight guardrails through these blog posts and the referenced overview and working agreement posters to ensure that we promote **consistent** and **laser focused** collaboration, with measurable outcomes, and an opportunity to drive our dream to optimize our meetings.

## Why do we insist on terms of reference?

![Meetings](../images/ceremony-overview-2.png)

We question the value of every ceremony and every meeting we plan or attend. The minimal expectations for the terms of reference identifies the purpose, the outcomes, and a measurable hypothesis. This promotes consistency and purpose!
