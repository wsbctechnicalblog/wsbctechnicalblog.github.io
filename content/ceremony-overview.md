Summary: Taking a step back and digesting this weeks storm of ceremony posts.

During this week we launched a tsunami of blog posts focused on our [Community of Enablement](/images/coming-soon.png) (CoE), [Dojo](/images/coming-soon.png), [Townhall](/images/coming-soon.png), [Working Group](/images/coming-soon.png), and [Community of Practice](/images/coming-soon.png) (CoP) ceremonies. Behind the scenes we also launched our first CoE to dogfood (evaluate our own stuff) guardrails, posters, and working agreements we created.

In this post I will answer some of the questions we received to date.
