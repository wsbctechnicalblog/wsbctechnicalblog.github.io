Summary: Safe and healthy workplaces. Compassionate and responsive service.

I could take a shortcut and refer you to the [WorkSafeBC Top Employer 2022](https://reviews.canadastop100.com/top-employer-worksafebc) article. It showcases why WorkSafeBC was voted as a top employer in 2022, during the challenging Covid pandemic.

Instead I will emphasize the humbling mission that fuels me with energy every day - "_Prevent workplace injury, illness, and death, and support injured workers through fair compensation and effective rehabilitation._" - and introduce WorkSafeBC through the lens of our vibrant EDO Common Engineering team.
