Every CoE can trigger one or more CoPs throughout its lifetime.

# What is our secret sauce?

Here is a recipe for our Community of Practice ceremonies:

## Executive buy-in!

Every Working Group inherits the executive support to be empowered with a clear strategy, an innovation budget, and support where needed from its parent Centre of Enablement (CoE).

## Cross-discipline collaboration!

Working Groups rely on cross-discipline collaboration to research and resolve a specific problem or (dis)prove a hypothesis, as requested by its parent CoE.

## Consistency

Working Groups must monitor and incentivize their members to adhere to the Working Group guardrails, and use shared blueprints, working agreements, backlogs, processes, and products consistently. Consistency is pivotal to share and implement the Working Group outcomes through its parent CoE.

## Transparency 

Transparency of hypothesis, visions, goals, and outcomes are pivotal to avoid duplication of effort, creation of **WASTE**, and fuel the overall energy. The CoE-Sync and the **Townhall** event are two of the key ceremonies that enable the sharing of Working Group deliverables and outcomes.

## Consistent guardrails!

CoPs require guardrails and a blueprint to standup and energize. Here are some of our guidelines, sorted alphabetically:

- 2-pizza sized team (3-9 members).
- Groomed and prioritized subset of the CoE backlog
- Innovation charge code for members to commit their time.
- Membership is by invitation only.
- Short-term lifetime ranging from iterations to a maximum of 2 program increments (10 iterations).
- Terminate if problem is solved, maximum lifetime is reached, there is no energy, or there is no value.
- **Terms of Reference** defining **WHY** we are here and **WHAT** are our objectives and hypothesist that defines the Working Group's existence and purpose.
- Triggered by CoE.
- Recognition of attendance.
- Weekly to bi-weekly cadence.

Also have a look at our Community of Practice working agreement poster for a crisp summary of these and other guidelines.
