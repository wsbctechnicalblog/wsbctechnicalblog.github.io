# Communicating sideways with per managers

<TBD>

Communicating with peer managers can be important for collaborating effectively and achieving shared goals. Here are some tips for effective communication with peer managers:

Schedule regular meetings: Set up regular meetings with your peer managers to discuss current projects, issues, and progress. This will help ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards common goals.

Be respectful: Treat your peer managers with respect and professionalism. Avoid talking down to them or making assumptions about their knowledge or abilities.

Listen actively: Listen carefully to what your peer managers have to say and ask questions to clarify any misunderstandings. Try to understand their perspective and be open to their ideas and suggestions.

Use clear and concise language: Avoid using technical jargon or overly complex language that your peer managers may not be familiar with. Use simple and clear language to communicate your ideas effectively.

Focus on solutions: When discussing issues or problems, focus on finding solutions rather than placing blame or criticizing. Collaborate with your peer managers to find solutions that work for everyone.

Follow up: After meetings or discussions, follow up with your peer managers to ensure that everyone is clear on next steps and any actions that need to be taken.

Be proactive: Don't wait for your peer managers to initiate communication. Reach out to them regularly to stay connected and build a strong working relationship.
