Summary: Without real-time evidence, OODA never comes to life.

[John Boyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)) argued that the key to victory is the ability to create situations in which one can make appropriate decisions more quickly than one's opponent. **O**bserve the environment, **O**rient to be in a good position, **D**ecide what to do next, and **A**ct accordingly. His OODA state machine is based on real-time feedback, gathered while observing the environment.

Similarly, hypothesis-driven development (HDD) relies on feedback to be in a position to evaluate the experiment, decide if it is a FAIL or PASS, and learn from it.

Both **OODA** and **HDD** become worthless black holes if we remove the **feedback**. Your dream to fail-fast, continuously learn, and continuously improve evaporates before your very eyes, and you will embark on a nightmare journey, without clues, insight, or early-warnings.
