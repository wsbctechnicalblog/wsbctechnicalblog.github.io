Summary: Ensuring that our solutions meet quality guardrails and governance from ideation to deprecation.

Post-deployment analysis, audits and inspection does not improve quality - it is usually too late, resulting in spectacular failures. While we can learn from these failures, they tend to be expensive and reputation busters - remember, first impressions last!

Quality must be built-in from the moment a team has an idea until the feature or product is deprecated. Also, it is the responsibility of all stakeholders, such as development, operations, architecture, security, and business. It should therefore comes as no surprise that built-in quality is the North Star of our EDO Common Engineering [Center of Enablement](https://wsbctechnicalblog.github.io/ceremony-overview.html).

Let me explore three (3) of many parts of the **built-in quality** puzzle in our common engineering system.
