Summary: The notion of developers relying on testers to validate changes can be so startling that it feels like my head might explode.

I am from an era characterized by distinct roles of programmers, testers, and systems analysts, each with their specialized tasks and a rigid handoff of responsibilities for testing. However, over past decades I have transitioned into a modern **DevOps** landscape where **engineers** function as integral members of cross-functional teams. In this DevOps environment, every team member holds themselves accountable for the entire product lifecycle, from conceptualization to retirement, fostering a collective commitment to product excellence, quality assurance, and delighted end-users.

To thrive in our software development ecosystem, it is imperative for all team members to grasp these fundamental principles:

- **Embracing cross-functional product teams**, where diverse expertise converges to achieve common goals.
- **Cultivating a T-shaped engineering mindset**, blending deep expertise in one area with a broad understanding across disciplines.
- **Understanding the key traits that define an effective engineer**, encompassing technical prowess, adaptability, collaborative spirit, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.

Let me delve into these three pillars.

# Cross-functional product team

A cross-functional product team is a group of people who have various abilities and experiences and work together as a unit to accomplish a common objective related to the development, evaluation, deployment, upkeep, and enhancement of a product from beginning to end. Each team member contributes their distinct viewpoint, knowledge, and skills to form a product team that can adapt to changing needs and take responsibility for quality and service excellence.

Terminology that has no place in a effective cross-functional product team:

- _Them and us._
- _Organizational and/or responsibility silos._
- _Specific role functions, such as developers and testers._

I like to call a cross-functional product team a smooth-working team of engineers.

# T-Shaped Engineers

A T-shaped engineer is a term that refers to a professional who has both specialization in one area and a wide range of skills and knowledge across various areas. 

The **vertical** part of the "T" represents the specialization – the depth of knowledge and skill in a particular technical area, such as software development. 

The **horizontal** part of the "T" shows the engineer's ability to cooperate and work across different technical areas, such as project management, communication, teamwork, problem-solving skills, and **quality assurance**.

I argue, for example, that **quality** is the responsibility of every member of the team. This includes development, maintaining, running, and analyzing quality assurance – such as unit, integration, system, and regression tests.

As shown above, I expect everyone on the product team to be experienced in, to own, and to collaborate around **QUALITY**.

Some terms that are not helpful in a productive cross-functional product team:

- _Not my job._
- _Not my responsibility._
- _You do the coding, I do the testing – or vice versa._

# Effective Engineers

Finally, I want to discuss what traits are essential for being an engineer. As you can see below, I look for thirteen (13) traits in engineers who join our team(s).

Sorted alphabetically ...

- **CHANGE** - thirst for change, evolution, and continuous learning.
- **COLLABORATE** - collaboration and presentation skills and a constant desire to improve them.
- **CURIOSITY** - peek under the hood, open the black-box, and show an unstoppable curiosity of finding out the WHAT, WHO, and WHY.
- **DETAIL** - notice the details.
- **FAIL** - do not be afraid to try new things and fail. "If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough." - Elon Musk.
- **IMPROVE** - make things better, more efficient and effective.
- **INNOVATE** - think creatively, experiment continuously, learn, pivot, and apply new ideas.
- **LOGIC** - having a logical mind and analytical skills.
- **OPTIMISM** - stay optimistic when dealing with challenges and uncertainties that are part of an engineer's world.
- **PASSION** - show a deep passion and strong commitment to specialized and generalized knowledge and role areas.
- **SOLVE PROBLEMS** - problem-solving skill and eagerness to constantly overcome and solve problems we face daily.
- **TEAM** - help the team succeed. "We are in this together."
- **TRUST** - trust is crucial for creating strong bonds between colleagues, teams, and organizations.

Expressions that send shivers down my spine when uttered by someone claiming to be an engineer:

- _I have no time to explore and learn._
- _Why would I want to learn something new?_
- _It is 5 o'clock and time to call it a day. We will troubleshoot tomorrow._
- _No need to change, this has worked for us for many years._

I have been a software engineer for four decades and **LOVE** my work - which is why I have probably never felt like working in my life q;-)

Am I off course? What are your thoughts on this topic?
