Summary: Introducing the voice of reason and stewards of guardrails

We are T+74 calendar days into the journey of our EDO Common Engineering team and it is time to shared and update our team journal, post 2.

Changing the culture and mindset of engineers and business stakeholders of an organization based on stringent security policies, processes, and segregation of duties takes grit, tenacity, a thick skin, and lots of patience. It feels like trying to change course of a massive oil-tanker travelling through heavy seas at full speed.

# WHY do we need our EDO Common Engineering Team?

We want everyone to embrace a healthy DevOps mindset to empower development and operations collaboration and enable us, as an organization, to “delight our end-users”, most importantly our BC employers and workers, our WorkSafeBC workers, and IT engineers. It is important the we shift the focus from creating technological marvels and snowflakes, to reducing waste, automate everything automable, and delivering value to our end-users.

Therefore, our goal is not just automation and enabling technology, but to deliver value. Any innovation, transformation, or measured value is worthless, unless we can continuously deliver value to our end-users. It is important to understand that DevOps is not a silver bullet, nor is it a product we can buy and install. It is a mindset that enables people to **collaborate** and follow a known **process** enabled by **products** to deliver **value** to our end users.

Also, instead of starting with a focus on our burning platform, our team agreed to focus on establishing an efficient system of highways, roads and railroads that enable both our business and engineering teams to focus on outcomes that delight our end-users. Automated circuit-breakers and smoke detectors monitor the health of our ecosystem, while we continuously improving outcomes.

We need to empower engineers and products to integrate and shift-left security, create quality governance guardrails and documentation, leverage the Azure cloud to its fullest potential, encourage experimentation, and a tolerance for failure to fuel innovation.

Noble goals, but WHY do we heed the EDO COmmon Engineering team? As mentioned in [What is origin of our common engineering team](https://wsbctechnicalblog.github.io/common-engineering-journal-1.html) we are the catalyst to:

- Encourage and enable everyone’s creativity, passion, purpose, and strengths!
- Declare war on WASTE, such as cycle time, excessive meetings, complexity, and manual processes.

# WHAT is the goal of our 90-day Roadmap?

When we lit the candle of our team's first stage, our goal for the first 90-days after launch was to lay the foundations and ensure that we have:

- A common and sound **vision**.
- Vibrant **collaboration**.
- An atmosphere encouraging **failure**, **learning**, and continuous **innovation**.
- A healthy **DevOps** mindset - "_DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users_", by [Donovan Brown](https://www.donovanbrown.com/post/what-is-devops).

Once we have a foundation, we plan to enable, foster, and steward **COLLABORATION**, engineering **PRACTICES**, and **QUALITY**.
