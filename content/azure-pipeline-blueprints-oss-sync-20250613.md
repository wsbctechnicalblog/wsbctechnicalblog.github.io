Summary: Latest version and with small portfolio update.

We have confirmed there are no internal updates currently suitable for sharing with this communityâ€”rest assured, we are keeping a close watch. Behind the scenes, our focus has been on developing new app-type blueprints to expand coverage across our internal software development lifecycle. While these efforts are tailored for internal use and not directly applicable to the open-source project, they are driving meaningful progress.

One exciting enhancement: our bootstrap flow now validates the portfolio used by pipelines, A critical step forward for our self-service capabilities, as highlighted in our recent [Continuous Integration and Delivery Pipelines Cookbook](/announcement-ci-cd-cookbook.html). This improvement strengthens the foundation for scalable, autonomous development.

What else can/should/must we consider as part of our blueprints? Thoughts?
