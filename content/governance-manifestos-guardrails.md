Summary: The best way to create an engineering revolt is to enforce governance with the big stick.

# Common Language

TBD

- **Governance** – “_the act or process of governing or overseeing the control and direction of something_” (Merriam-Webster), such as Dev, Sec, and Ops standards.
- **Manifesto** – “_a written statement declaring publicly the intentions, motives, or views of its issuer_” (Merriam-Webster), such as [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and [DevOps Core Values](https://www.tactec.ca/devops-core-values/).
- **Guardrails** – “_a railing guarding usually against danger_” (Merriam-Webster), such as the sides of a bridge, 200m above a raging George, or naming guidance.

```markdown
Active Directory Group Names

Review AD AAD Security Groups for a list of organizational, project, and team-level groups.

- Guidelines
  - AzureDevOps_<Department>_<Project>[_<Team>]_<Role> format.
  - Avoid spaces. Use underscore (_) instead.
  - Prefix with 3rdParty for artifacts containing third-party resources.
- Examples
  - AzureDevOps_IT_CeS_ProjectAdministrators
  - AzureDevOps_Training_AgilePlanning_ReleaseApprovers
```

TBD so what's the issue, these look like soft guidance?

# Manifestos and guardrails are wolves in sheep skins

# Why not embrace Manifesto and Guardrail Mobbing?

What is mobbing? TBD

Enacting governance through engineering friendly manifestos and guardrails! TBD
