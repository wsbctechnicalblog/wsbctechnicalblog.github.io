Summary: Breaking Free: A Guide to Tackling Technical Debt Head-On

"When I glance at our [Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops?view=azure-devops) technical debt backlog, it is like revisiting the unforgettable scene from Jurassic Park, where Ian Malcolm walks up to a pile of dinosaur s**t.

Dealing with the seemingly impossible can feel overwhelming for any DevOps product team. Just like financial debt, overcoming technical debt requires a solid plan and unwavering commitment to action, with no room for compromise or excuses.

1. **Embrace the Reality and acknowledge the Problem** - Collaborate with your product owner, stakeholders, and team to establish a clear strategy for tackling technical debt head-on.

2. **Draw the Line and distinguish Bugs from Technical Debt** - Explore why bugs should not be mistaken for technical debt in the discussion on [Why Bugs are NOT Technical Debt](/engineering-practices-why-bugs-are-not-technical-debt.html).

3. **Continuously Categorize Technical Debt** - Organize your technical debt into categories like Architectural, Automation, Billing, Code, Design, End-of-Life (EoL), External Component, Infrastructure, Operational, Product, Security, and Test.

4. **Continuously Prioritize Technical Debt** - Focus on addressing the most critical and valuable issues first to prevent compounding interest, leveraging an experienced panel or working group to collaboratively prioritize tasks. Should you tackle end-of-life software or known vulnerabilities first, considering their potential impact on tomorrow's headlines or the return on investment?

5. **Continuously Track Technical Debt** - Routinely review and archive technical debt that has lingered for over a year or two, keeping it accessible for reference but out of public view. If your product and users have tolerated it for this long, its impact is likely minimal. We have adopted a similar strategy for shelving "would-be-cool" features from cluttering our product backlog.

6. **Invest in Automated Solutions** - Empower your engineers with automation tools to detect, comprehend, and mitigate technical debt efficiently. Consider initiatives like our AI Software Sentinel experiments, paving the way for proactive identification and resolution of potential issues through artificial intelligence.
