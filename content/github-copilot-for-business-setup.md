Summary: Getting started with GitHub Copilot - Step 1: Setup.

To kickstart your journey with the GitHub Copilot for Business product, we first need to configure both the service-side and user-side environments. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps we took and highlight any potential obstacles you may encounter along the way.

Below is an insightful illustration sourced from [GitHub](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM) that provides a user-friendly overview of Enterprise Managed Users (EMU).

# Service-side Setup

The [GitHub Managed Users (EMU)](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users) is comprehensive, though it is detailed to the extent that you might overlook a crucial step (as we did). Here are the key steps:

- Setup a [GitHub Managed Users (EMU)](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users).
  - Chat with your Microsoft / GitHub account manager and request  enterprise.
- Setup the IdP Connection
  - Install [GitHub EMU Application](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/aad.fabrikamenterprisemanageduseroidc?tab=Overview).
- Step 1: Preparations
  - Involve a person with AAD Admin Access
  - Create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) for the ``EMU Admin`` account
- Step 2: Connect GitHub to AAD using OIDC
  - Have these handy: ``EMU Name``, ``EMU Enterprise URL``, and ``EMU shortcode``!
  - Follow all steps in the [GitHub Docs: Configuring OIDC for Enterprise Managed Users](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/configuring-oidc-for-enterprise-managed-users) to setup the connection.
- Step 3: Configure SCIM Provisioning
  - Have these handy: ``EMU Name``, ``EMU Enterprise URL``, ``EMU shortcode``, and your tenant URL, for example ``https://api.github.com/scim/v2/enterprises/fabrikam``!
  - Follow all the steps in [Azure Tutorial: Configure GitHub Enterprise Managed User (OIDC) for automatic user provisioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/github-enterprise-managed-user-oidc-provisioning-tutorial).
- Step 4: Once connected, connect subscription
  - Have these handy: ``GitHub Organization`` and ``GitHub Team`` names.
  - [Connect an Azure Subscription ID](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/connecting-an-azure-subscription#connecting-your-azure-subscription-to-your-enterprise-account) to pay for Copilot.
  - [Enable Copilot at the Enterprise Level](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-copilot-in-your-enterprise).
  - In your Organization of choice, [enable Copilot for the user/team of choice](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-in-your-organization). In our scenario, we handle GitHub team membership through an Azure Directory (AD) group. Being a member of the AD group automatically grants you membership in the GitHub team, providing access to a GitHub Copilot license.

 Single-signon is alive and well. At this point you should be able to login with your ``EMU Admin`` and your ``corporate`` cedentials.

# User-side Setup

This is likely the section everyone is eager to dive into â€“ welcoming your Artificial Intelligence (AI) Copilot and embarking on a journey of exploration to reap numerous benefits. These include heightened productivity, enhanced quality, accelerated experimentation and learning, and bolstered engineering confidence.

## Before you begin!

- First you need to logout of GitHub in your default web browser.â€¯ 
- Then go to Visual Studio (VS) Code and sign-out.â€¯
- Make sure you IDE is the latest version.


Failure to do so may lead you down the same nightmarish path I experienced last weekend.

## Visual Studio ENterprise / Professional

> A special **thank you** to my copilot, [Martin Lacey](https://wsbctechnicalblog.github.io/pages/authors.html)], who completed the setup first, giving us the dos and do nots, as well as the screenshots.
>

- Open Visual Studio Enterprise and go to ``Profile > Add Account``.
- This will open your browser. Use your corporate account, for ``demo_fabrikam``. Your account name will be different, but follow the same format.
- Once you enter your account name (no password) and press ``enter``, you will be directed to the following web page after a short moment.

- Click on ``Authorize GitHub``.

  > ![Authorize](../images/github-copilot-for-business-setup-3.png)

- Close Visual Studio and restart it.
- Verify that you are now connected.

- Now it is time to start exploring!!!

## Visual Studio Code

- Ensure you are running at least version 1.83, dated September 2023, by checking for updates.

  > ![Check for updates](../images/github-copilot-for-business-setup-5.png)

- If not already done, install GitHub CoPilot:
  
  > ![Install Copilot](../images/github-copilot-for-business-setup-6.png)

- After installation, log in to GitHub using your EMU Account (GitHub Enterprise Managed Users) such as ``demo_fabrikam``. Alternatively, you can modify your profile to add the GitHub account.

  > ![<SAMPLE PIC>](../images/github-copilot-for-business-setup-7.png)

- Authorize the access.

  > ![Authorize](../images/github-copilot-for-business-setup-8.png)

- Once authorized, you will see the following view within VS Code.

  > ![Check authorization](../images/github-copilot-for-business-setup-9.png)

- Now you are ready to explore the walkthroughs and get started!  ðŸ˜Š

If you sign-out from GitHub on your default browser, as per **before you begin**, you can save yourself a lot of pain! Have fun chatting with your AI Pair Engineer Copilot and watch this space for follow-up posts my my colleagues evaluating their Copilot.
