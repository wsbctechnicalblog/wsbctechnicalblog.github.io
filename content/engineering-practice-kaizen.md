Summary: Kaizen - Continueous Improvement

# What is Kaizen?

Kaizen is a term I became familiar with while working at a Toyota manufacturing plant here in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia; it is part of the Toyota culture.  The word "Kaizen" as it is a Japanese term that means "improvement".  But it is much, much more than that - it is embodies a way of thinking; it is a concept refering to continuously improving all functions and involving all employees (and contractors) of an organization.

> **Wikipedia**  - (Japanese: 改善, "improvement") is a concept referring to business activities that continuously improve all functions and involve all employees from the CEO to the assembly line workers. Kaizen also applies to processes, such as purchasing and logistics, that cross organizational boundaries into the supply chain.[1] It has been applied in healthcare,[2] psychotherapy,[3] life coaching, government, and banking.

>By improving standardized programs and processes, kaizen aims to eliminate waste and redundancies (lean manufacturing). Kaizen was first practiced in Japanese businesses after World War II, influenced in part by American business and quality-management teachers, and most notably as part of The Toyota Way. It has since spread throughout the world and has been applied to environments outside of business and productivity.

When fully embraced, it crosses organizational boundaries and breaks-down cilos, improving communication and processes while reducing *muda* (waste).

# How does Kaizen apply to Software Engineering?

As described above, Kaizen is applied in all aspects of the Toyota business and across all areas and processes, and involved everyone - from CEO to line workers, software engineering to accounting, managers and marketing.  But it has a special place in my heart when applied to Software Engineering - as it effects not only the process and methods we employ, but how we *do* and *view* our work to build viable and then valuable solutions and products.

In Software Engineering, we commonly experience the Kaizen perspective when we are called upon to make changes to existing software - or indeed, when analyzing the requirements and the design of new applications; we know it as *refactoring*.  We look for opportunities to improve the efficiency and quality of the code we are tasked to revise to accomodate a change, enhancement, or bug fix.  In the next section I'll break-down the various types of Kaizen (Contineous Improvement) opportunities that exist in our Software Engineering eco-system.

# The Kaizen Mindset
We often get opportunties for Kaizen of our software solution when they evolove, and new features are required of them - or faults are found in existing implementations.  The *Kaizen Mindset* is one that is continuously looking for ways to improve what we build *and* how we build it. This is further amplified when we have also adopted the *product mindset*, when we have *skin in the game* and we own what we build.  In this case, you have a vested interest in its longevity, capabities, and quality since it is our personal work and the work of our team that is on display; t reflects our hard work, passion, and *ingenuity*.
