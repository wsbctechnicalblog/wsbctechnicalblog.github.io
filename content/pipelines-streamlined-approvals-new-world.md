Summary: 

In the previous [Streamlining your pipeline approvals, without flooding DevSecOps with noise](/pipelines-streamlined-approvals.html) post we covered streamlined approvals and the magic and challenges of artifact filters. In essence, we discussed the Jurassic era of classic Azure Pipelines.

 In this post we will switch gears and compare it to the era of state-of-the-art YAML-based Azure Pipelines.

 Most of the engineers I recently discussed this magic with, looked at me with the _"what are you talking about?!?"_ glazed look.

 A really worrying trend, because the Microsoft [documentation](https://aka.ms/yaml) is comprehensive and the associated features amazing - hence this post.

Right, if you are excited and interested in these YAML-based pipelines, I recommend that you review our [Pipeline Series](/why-pipelines-part1.html) which delves deeper into the classic and new pipelines. If not, you are likely in the wrong movie.
