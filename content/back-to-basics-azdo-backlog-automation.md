> **IMPORTANT NOTES**:
>
> 1. Automation is **team** specific.
> 2. Automation is **backlog-level** specific.
> 3. Automation only triggers for work items that **belong to the same team**!
>

A special note for **Pam**:

>
> **IMPACT ON SCORECARD BACKLOG**:
>
> #3 affects our scorecard backlog. The automation won't work when linked children from other projects and/or teams are closed, if they are attached to scorecard parents.
