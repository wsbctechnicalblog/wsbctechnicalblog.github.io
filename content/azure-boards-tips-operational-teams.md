Summary: A few useful "did you know" tips when using Azure Boards for Operational-type teams.

After observing users work with and occasionally struggle with the [Azure Boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/devops/boards/), it is time for me to share a few tips. We continue from [Agile Boards Tips](/agile-boards-tips.html) and focus on operational teams this time.

Lastly, again remember the [Delivery Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/devops/boards/plans/review-team-plans?view=azure-devops) which allows you to create a delivery board-type plan view combining multiple teams, backlogs, and iteration cadences. The delivery plan configuration of settings and styles is similar to the board, but it also allow you to collapse cards and show dependencies.

> **IMPORTANT**
> Dependencies are only shown for predecessor/successor links and dependency lines are only drawn if both the predecessor and successor cards are visible on the delivery plan view.

Any other tips to share?
