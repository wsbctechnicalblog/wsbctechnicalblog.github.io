:excerpt: Alex got a good idea!.

It all starts with paragraphs.
  Plain text, separated by empty lines.
  The text lines of a paragraph are wrapped together.

      Indent your paragraph if you want a nice blockquote.

  You can *emphasize* text in a paragraph using asterisks.
  Double asterisks give **more** emphasis.
  You can wrap multiple words to *emphasize all of them*.
