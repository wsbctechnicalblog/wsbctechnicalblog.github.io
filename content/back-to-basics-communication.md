Summary: Stop the context-less "hi, hello, ping, pong, ..."

I already discussed the issues of [Stop the meeting overload!](/stop-the-meeting-hell.html), [How to track (and optimize) your email traffic](/optimize-and-track-emails.md.html), [How to tame your vacation email traffic](/optimize-and-avoid-emails.md.html), and [Stop the context switching, reduce waste, and focus on value](/context-switching-no-more.html) in 2021 and 2022. Unfortunately, I still receive unproductive chat messages, get annoyed by email overload, and am asked to attend large meetings where 2 users take over the conversation, while 13 other engineers wonder why they were been dragged into the discussion. We all start multi-tasking (context-switching), until someone asks the infamous question “what do you think <yourname>?" to pull everyone who has gone very, very quiet back into the discussion. 

If you have read this far, I assume you are in a similar boat. Let me go back to basics and see what my team learned and recommends for effective email, meetings, and chats.

# Email

Some email etiquettes and rules to follow are:

- **Use chat**, like Microsoft teams, or an in-person spit-balling whiteboard session for discussions or ideation, not emails.
- Only expect recipients on **To** to respond, not those on Cc (for your information) or Bcc (hidden).
- Keep an email on one topic and thread, do not **split** or **mix it up**.
- Do not change the subject or reuse a finished email thread for a new topic.
- **Reply all with caution** - you could start an email storm.

And a new one we have added to our list:

- Please provide **context** when you add someone to an email thread, especially a long one, so they do not have to spend time reading the thread backwards. Not everyone has Copilot for Microsoft 365 to get an AI assisted recap.

# Meetings

> ![Meetings](../images/back-to-basics-communication-2.png) 

As per the image above, some meeting etiquettes to improve your work:life balance and productivity:

- Give and get **value** or leave.
- Stop **T-5 minutes** before the end.
- No meetings on **Friday**.
- No meeting without **agenda** or **purpose**.
- Avoid **acronyms** or **jargon**.
- Write down **notes** and share them with **action items** - or use Copilot for Microsoft Teams to do it for you. I LOVE that productivity feature, powered by AI!
- **Focus** on the meeting, without laptops, when in meeting person.

Do not make someone who arrives late to an in-person meeting in a huge building do pushups for each minute they missed – they might have run a long way from another meeting that was valuable but was on time or ran over.

# Teams / Slack / Chat

> ![Chat](../images/back-to-basics-communication-3.png) 

As in scenario 1, I get stressed when people use chat programs like Microsoft Teams, Slack, or text messages to say "hi", "ping", or "do you have a second" and then make me wait for context.

I do not react anymore, because it is unproductive. Before, I used to **switch context**, **wait** patiently, or politely ask for the missing **context** - but it is frustrating and distracting, especially when I am trying to focus.

Instead, as in scenario 2, please be courteous and say "Hi", but more importantly add the context and/or question. That way the receiver can decide whether to reply right away, or later.

Add [NoHello](https://sbmueller.github.io/nohello/) to your email signature and/or your collaboration tool status message to remind everyone of keeping the collaboration **simple** and **productive**.
