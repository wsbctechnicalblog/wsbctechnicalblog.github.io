Summary: A candid exploration of engineering myths, misplaced certainties, and the binary truths that shape how we build, decide, and lead.

Six months ago, while recovering from an open‑heart surgery, I found myself spending an insane amount of time copy‑editing the journal I had written during that chapter of turbulence. It was gruelling and strangely grounding. If you or a loved one is navigating a similar storm, please feel free to reach out to me. I will gladly exchange learnings, reflections, and the practical truths that only surface when life forces you to slow down and look inward. And yes, in February I will be releasing my journal, **Wired 4 Change**, a collection of insights gathered across more than forty years in Software Engineering.

That experience changed me. My outlook on life has shifted. My view of work:life balance has stabilised. And my tolerance for bad ideas, ambiguity, incidents, and unnecessary costs and risk has dropped to near zero. When your heart is rewired, your priorities follow.

In a (hopefully) fortnightly cadence, I will map the cracks between assumptions and reality. I will examine engineering bloopers with a blend of humour and precision. I will debunk the myths that continue to mislead teams and leaders. And I will provide binary clarity for both makers and executives, reducing ambiguity, eliminating unnecessary incidents, and avoiding wasted spend.

In short, I will be your devil’s advocate across a range of uncomfortable, overdue conversations. We will tackle questions such as “Is Azure DevOps dead?”, “Is GitHub the answer?”, and “Are we asking the right AI question?”. These topics deserve more than whispers, hand‑waving, or zealot thinking. They deserve honesty, analysis, and a bias towards action.

I encourage you to engage. Add your comments. Challenge the ideas. Start discussions. Together, we can collaborate on healthier ways to maintain our work:life balance while improving stakeholder experience and reducing risk and cost across our ecosystem.

Welcome to the journey. Let us build something better, one myth at a time.
