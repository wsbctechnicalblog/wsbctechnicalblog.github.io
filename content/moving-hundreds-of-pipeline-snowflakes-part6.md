Summary: Neither the bootstrap nor generic templates are rocket science, and the YAML-based pipelines are as complex as **you** make them.

Welcome back to another installment of our exciting pipeline journey, as outlined in [part 1](/why-pipelines-part1.html). After introducing the blueprint templates on [part 5](/yaml-pipelines-part5.html), it is time to emphasise that these new YAML-based pipelines are not complex if applied correctly.

# What is next?

Now that we all agree that neither the bootstrap nor generic templates are rocket science, and that YAML-based pipelines are as complex as **you** make them, we can move ahead with the adoption of our new pipelines. But wait, there is more ... in the next part 7, my colleague Said will introduce the next generation of blueprints which are even simpler, supporting our goals for consistency and enablement. 

See you in part 7 (coming soon).
