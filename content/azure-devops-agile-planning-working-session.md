Summary: Recalling the recent agile planning session hosted by common engineering during the +1 innovation and planning iteration.

Our team developed an interactive session to highlight the benefits of Azure DevOps Boards for Agile Planning, focusing solely on out-of-the-box features many, many moons ago. Recently, we handed over this session to our Agile Coaches for future improvements and hosting. 

This blog post summarizes our shared insights, exercise outcomes, and provides references for other Azure Boards posts to conclude the fun working session.
