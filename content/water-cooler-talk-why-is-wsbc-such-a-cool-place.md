Summary: At a recent water cooler we chatted about why WorkSafeBC is such a cool place to work for.

Water cooler talk occurs when we take a break from work, socialize with each other, and collaborate about things like hobbies, favourite beer brews, and other fun topics not associated with work.

For me it is the **culture**, the **flexibility** (working from home), the **opportunity** to dabble with old, current, and future technologies, the **leadership** focused on **empowering** and **trusting** staff, and the amazing **benefits**.

On the other hand, my team is self-managed and self-organized. If I had to summarize our vision in two words I would pick **empower** and **collaborate** - and yes, **empower** overlaps with the leadership. We even get the opportunity to write a cookbook to explain our history with Azure Pipelines, our future, and share all our gotchas and learnings - tentative title is "Continuous Integration and Delivery Pipelines Cookbook".

With that we made our way back to work. For more, read my [can government agencies be innovative](/can-government-agencies-be-innovative.html) post and peruse my story:
