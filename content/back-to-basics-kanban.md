Summary: "Kanban" is Japanese for "visual card" or "signal."

Kanban is a method of visually managing work processes, often used in lean and just-in-time production. It was developed by Taiichi Ohno for Toyota as a way to improve manufacturing efficiency and the word **Kanban*** means **visual card** or **signal** in Japanese. The system uses visual cues to initiate and manage workflow processes.

Kanban is a visual management method for optimizing work processes, often associated with lean and just-in-time production. It originated in Japan and was initially developed by Taiichi Ohno for Toyota as a way to improve manufacturing efficiency.

The word "Kanban" is Japanese for "visual card" or "signal." The system relies on visual cues to trigger and manage workflow processes. The primary components of a Kanban system include:

Kanban Board: A visual representation of the work process, typically divided into columns representing different stages of the workflow. Common columns include "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

Cards: Physical or digital cards that represent individual tasks or work items. Each card contains information about the task, such as its description, priority, and assignee.

Work in Progress (WIP) Limits: Constraints placed on the number of tasks allowed in each column at a given time. WIP limits prevent overloading and help maintain a smooth flow of work.

Signals: Visual cues, often in the form of cards or markers, that indicate the status of a task or whether it can progress to the next stage.

The key principles of Kanban include:

Visualizing the Workflow: Making the work visible helps teams understand and manage their processes more effectively.

Limiting Work in Progress: Setting WIP limits helps prevent bottlenecks and ensures a more even flow of work through the system.

Managing Flow: Focusing on the smooth and efficient flow of work from one stage to the next.

Continuous Improvement: Encouraging teams to analyze their processes and make incremental improvements over time.

Kanban is not limited to manufacturing or software development; it has found applications in various industries and disciplines, including project management, marketing, and customer support. The flexibility of Kanban makes it adaptable to different organizational contexts, making it a popular choice for teams aiming to improve their workflow efficiency.
