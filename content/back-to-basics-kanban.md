Summary: "Kanban" is Japanese for "visual card" or "signal."

Kanban is a method of visually managing work processes, often used in lean and just-in-time production. It was developed by Taiichi Ohno for Toyota as a way to improve manufacturing efficiency and the word **Kanban*** means **visual card** or **signal** in Japanese. The system uses visual cues to initiate and manage workflow processes.

here are the main components of a Kanban system and a few reference links:
