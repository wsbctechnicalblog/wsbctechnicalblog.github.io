Summary: "Kanban" is Japanese for "visual card" or "signal."

Kanban is a method of visually managing work processes, often used in lean and just-in-time production. It was developed by Taiichi Ohno for Toyota as a way to improve manufacturing efficiency and the word **Kanban*** means **visual card** or **signal** in Japanese. The system uses visual cues to initiate and manage workflow processes.

here are the main components of a Kanban system and a few reference links:

# Actionable Cards

It annoys me when I have to deal with a card that I cannot act on. Here are cards that should be discarded or should cause the [Andon cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_(manufacturing)) to be pulled:

You can use [Azure Boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/boards/) to apply Kanban principles, whether you work with Kanban only or combine Kanban (operational support) and Scrum (innovation), like we do. I'm a visual thinker, so I find the visual signals from Kanban very helpful. Have fun!
