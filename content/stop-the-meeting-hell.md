Summary: Notes from a recent improvement "meeting" to stop meetings. 

Thank you for the opportunity to collaborate on a very important topic, that will help us raise productivity and lower stress … as well as errors caused by excessive context switching.

To start, I would like to get rid of my pet peeve of our new remote and video conferencing era. No-one with a healthy meeting etiquette would barge into the following meeting environment to ask you to join another meeting.

Correct?

Then why are you using the worst Microsoft Teams feature to call a colleague who is busy in another scheduled event to join your meeting?

This causes interruptions for all … be right back … Willy what do you think … Willy? … back … What did I miss? These interruptions drive me insane. 

For the person being teleported out of the meeting it means a context switch … and I, for example, start making mistakes and forgetting things when I battered by context switching.

Back to the actual topic … can we stop the meeting madness? So, what is the actual problem?

We have to choose whether we want to improve productivity and balance work:life, or continue the multi-tasking, context-switching overload. 

The choice is yours … my team and I are taking the right turn!

Here are a few examples of OUR calendars … on a good day. 

Let us look at one and spot the challenges.

Looking at this example we will notice a few things.

1. We have back-to-back meetings. Context-switching hell, with few opportunities to take a break.
2. Double and triple booked meetings … how many clones of me are you expecting to join your meetings?
3. Meetings booked after working hours ... unthought of in the days of people walking out of the office to catch their last bus.
4. Everyone is working extra hours to catch-up with their commitments … as productivity outside of meetings was low all day.

In fact, this person had 4 hours to relax or work during four working days. That means this person spend 87.5% productive hours going from meeting to meeting without a break. That is crazy and NOT sustainable. 

In our regular stress-o-meter polls the feedback clearly points to one worrying outcome of this madness, namely “STRESS”.

As per our team working agreement, we are trying hard to …

- Finish meetings 5-minutes early, instead of bleeding into other meetings.
- Have a meeting free Friday, by blocking our Friday and, by not scheduling meetings on a Friday.
- If there is no agenda, purpose, or we add or receive no value, we eject ourselves from the meeting.
- We expand all three lettered acronyms when speaking to ensure we create no time wasting confusion.
- Conclude every meeting with actionable notes.

In addition, I have asked my team to block out their lunch hours and to decline all double bookings to reduce the context switching and associated.

In my humble opinion, we need an organizational working agreement, which:

- Encourages a respectful meeting etiquette
- Fosters collaboration
- Focuses on productivity
- Enables a healthy work:life balance
- And pivots our culture from meetings to delivery

Thank you for listening. Thoughts? Questions?
