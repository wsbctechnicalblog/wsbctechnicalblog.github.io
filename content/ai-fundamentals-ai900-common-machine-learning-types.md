## Notes

- Training a **Regression** model involves data gathering and transformation: Feature selection --> Cleaning --> Normalization (or feature engineering).

## Example

>
> You need to examine historical data to forecast price ranges for your product. Label = prediction = price range.
>

- The **classification** model is ``suitable`` for supervised learning to determine ``is it`` a low, medium, high, or very high price.
- The **regression** model is ``inappropriate`` because it forecasts numerical values rather than determining whether something belongs to the "is it" class.
- The **clustering** model is ``inappropriate`` because it clusters unlabeled data into similar groups.
