Summary: By structuring an effective prompt, we can transformed this raw blog into a meaningful and inspiring summary. 

This blog post discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to **augment** capabilities, allowing for quick handling of tedious, time-consuming tasks. AI is applied in various areas such as analyzing complex documents, processing raw survey feedback, and extracting insights from blog posts that have taken years to develop. This **empowering** technology is changing the way work is conducted and information is interpreted - as our technical blog is public, I will use [chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/) today, but could also use the Microsoft 365 Copilot.

# Prompting

> ![Document Analysis](../images/ai-fundamentals-prompt-analysis-1.png) 

Prompting involves giving an AI model input or instructions to guide its response. A prompt is the question, statement, or command given to the AI, shaping its output. The quality of the prompt determines the effectiveness of the AI, making it a useful tool for tasks like content creation, data analysis, problem-solving, and automation.

I began with a simple prompt for a blog post summary, which produced a basic result. I improved the prompt by chatting with AI, learned the following and I quote:

>
> "A great prompt should be:
> 
> - Clear and Specific: Define what you want to achieve.
> - Engaging and Inspiring: Encourage deeper exploration.
> - Structured and Goal-Oriented: Ensure logical progression.
> - Contextually Rich: Provide relevant background.
> - Flexible yet Focused: Allow creativity while maintaining direction." ... end quote.
> 

The final prompt I used was the following: `Please analyze our technical blog at https://wsbctechnicalblog.github.io/index.html and create a comprehensive summary. Group insights based on tags or categories and highlight key learnings, innovations, and best practices shared in the blog. Capture the value it provides to technical audiences, emphasizing any groundbreaking ideas, industry trends, or practical takeaways. The summary should be structured, engaging, and inspiring, making it easy for readers to grasp the significance of the content. Include a detailed summary of number of tags and blog pages analysed.
`

AI document analysis quickly produced this summary, saving hours of work. A true productivity boost!

While it can be disheartening to see AI quickly analyze and summarize what took us years to create, it is also refreshing and empowering. Rather than spending days on mundane analysis and documentation tasks, AI empowers us to focus on more challenging, interesting, and enjoyable work. One of the reasons I often begin an AI conversation with `hello` or `please`, and end it with `thank you`, is to maintain a sense of courtesy and respect with my matrix wingman.
