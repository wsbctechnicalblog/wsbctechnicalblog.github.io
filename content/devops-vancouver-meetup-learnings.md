Summary: Insights gained from hosting six community meetups this year: the positives, negatives, and challenges.

We have been running the DevOps Vancouver meetup for years, enduring fantastic and tough sessions as well as the Covid pandemic. This year, we emerged from the pandemic and shifted from virtual-only meetings to a mix of virtual, hybrid, and in-person events. In this brief post, I will share insights from a busy first half of 2024, a summer break, and upcoming events.

One major realization I have made this year is that DevOps has matured, and the engineering community now embraces the mindset. We have progressed from basic DevOps to sharing innovations in the synergy of people, process, and products - there remains little interest in the fundamentals of DevOps. Additionally, Artificial Intelligence (AI)'s impact on DevOps is significant, and we are beginning to struggle with maintaining focus as AI overlaps with other areas, leading to conflicts with other meetups and duplication of events/focus.

# Negatives and Challenges

I will start by discussing the challenges of hosting meetups that meet both community needs and sponsor expectations. These are just my personal candid observations!

!!! ---
!!! It takes time, both personal and business.
!!! It requires commitment and a purpose.

**Logistics can be challenging** - We have hosted in-person meetups at various spots, but it is tough to find a perfect location for everyone, particularly for those using public transit. For example, our favorite venue, [UBC Sauder](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/) downtown, means I spend 4 hours on the bus - 1 hour to work, 1 hour to the meetup, and 2 hours home with limited connections later at night. While the meetups are great, they often result in a hectic, late evening for many members, leading to frustration when attendance and collaboration do not meet expectations.

!!! RSVP are not to be trusted.
!!! Polls are a waste of time.
!!! Hybrid does not work - either virtual or in-person.

# Positives

Next, I focus on the benefits, which undeniably surpass the disadvantages, though we might feel differently during hectic periods.

!!! +++
!!! Collaboration is energizing.
!!! In-person rocks.
!!! Demos help!
!!! Short, related sessions work best.
!!! Mentimeter works well.
