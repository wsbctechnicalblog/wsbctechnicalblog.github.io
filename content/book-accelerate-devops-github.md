Summary: "Enhance software delivery performance with GitHub Issues, Projects, Actions, and Advanced Security" - Michael Kaufman

In our book [Navigating DevOps through Waterfalls](https://www.tactec.ca/ndtw-resources/) I not only emphasize my support for [Donovan's definition of DevOps](https://www.donovanbrown.com/post/what-is-devops) as the "Union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users", but also that **products** represents only 5% of the DevOps pie.

# Accelerate DevOps with GitHub Book

So, when I received a copy of Michael's book "Accelerate DevOps with GitHub" to review, I was skeptical. Why bother with another technical **product**-based book, which would be out-of-date by the time I get to the end? 

> I could not have been more wrong!

Although the book is based on GitHub (**product** 5%), it shares experience and information that applies to the other core pieces of the DevOps pie - **process** (15%), and **people** (80%) in these six parts:

- Lean Management and Collaboration
- Engineering DevOps Practices
- Release with Confidence
- Software Architecture
- Lean Product Management
- GitHub for your Enterprise 

The book has become one of my invaluable references for topics such as _Metrics that matter_, _OKRs_ (objectives, key, results), _YAML basics_, _Feature Flags_, _Trunk-based Development_, _working with Git_, _Code Security_, _Testing_, and much more. What caught my eye throughout the book is Michael's focus on **keeping it simple** - love it!

# Meet the author - Michael Kaufman

We are pleased to announce that Michael will join us at our [DevOps Vancouver BC Canada Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/devops-vancouver-bc-canada/) at the end of November to talk about his book. For him it will be 4AM in the morning, demonstrating his passion for DevOps and commitment to share his knowledge.

Here is an outline of his meetup session:

**Accelerate DevOps – What I learned writing a book about GitHub**

When I was asked to write a book about GitHub, I first came up with an outline that had an introduction to DevOps with nearly 200 pages and then covered all GitHub Features in a logical order. “Nobody wants to read a 200-page introduction” was the phrase of my editor that made me completely rethink what I wanted to write about and how I should structure it.

In this session I want to share with you my learnings and explain why I chose the new structure for my book. I will explain how you can see the book as a practical step-by-step guide to a data-driven DevOps transformation.
