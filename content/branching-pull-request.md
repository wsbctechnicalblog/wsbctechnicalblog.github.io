Summary: Busting a few process myths around branching strategies and pull-requests

If you want to ignite a debate in a pub, casually start chatting about politics. In a [virtual] room of software engineers, gently mention branching strategies and pull requests. In both scenarios you can sit back and enjoy the vibrant chain reaction of experiences, opinions, and myths. In this brief article I will share our experience, our [standardization](/consistency-standardization.html) of branching strategies, our use of [pull requests](/pull-requests-friend.html), and bust a few myths along the way.

# Branching Strategies

TBD

> MYTH 1 - Trunk-based branching strategy is suited only for small and experienced teams!
>
> _The [Microsoft Azure DevOps](https://medius.studios.ms/Embed/Video/THR2017?sid=THR2017) and [Microsoft Office](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/improving-azure-devops-cherry-picking/) are two very large teams that poof that the trunk-based branching strategy scales from small and rapid experimentation and innovation teams, to large product-based teams._

> MYTH 2 - One branching strategy is better than another!

> _TBD_

# Pull Requests

TBD

> MYTH 3 - Pull-requests slow down your continuous integration value stream!
>
> _A pull request takes as long as you and your process allow it to sit in a corner and wait. We encourage our engineers to track the lead and cycle times of pull requests using the [Pull Request Completion Report](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OneLuckiDev.prApprovalReport&targetId=dc216ba3-25e9-46a8-823a-fb77a81f2a9f) and to **collaborate** with their peers to ensure that pull requests do not go stale._

> MYTH 4 - Trunk-based branching strategy and use of pull requests is a NO-NO!
>
> _TBD_

For branching strategies and the use of pull requests there is no silver bullet. Once you realize that consistency and standardization trumps personal preference and variations, you can pick the branching strategy and the use of pull-requests (or not) that empowers your engineers and organization.
