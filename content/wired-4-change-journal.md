# Contents of the journal

This journal covers a 40 years journey:

 - **The Spark**: Early 1980s, where it all began (yup, a long, long time ago). It all began with a Z80 Spectrum computer in the early nineteen eighties, learning structured thinking through Basic, Assembler, Cobol, and the C language. Political pressures in South Africa shaped early service experiences, while work at Burroughs and Unisys provided grounding in the CTOS operating system and cryptographic technologies. These moments formed the disciplined and resilient technical base for the career that followed.
 - **Growth and Grit**: My transition to PCs and seven memorable projects. Returning to South Africa led to work on CTOS support, financial system integrations, and Microsoft Windows NT solutions. Key projects included encryption module evaluations, banking integrations, and large scale performance testing. The author also contributed to the Application Lifecycle Management Rangers community, strengthening DevOps practices and guiding organisations through technical and cultural change.
 - **Lead and Adapt**: My excursion into management and the many transformations I was privileged to experience. This section contrasts managers, micromanagers, and leaders, showing that effective leadership is built on vision, empowerment, emotional intelligence, and trust. Leaders inspire and uplift, while micromanagement and control undermine value, harm morale, and erode stakeholder experience.
 - **Persona Pivot**: Reflections and learnings on leadership, mentorship, and coaching. Recent work centres on strategic thinking, mentoring, and supporting team well-being. A persona model featuring the Do-er, the Firefighter, and the Visionary helps teams understand alignment. The author reflects on digital transformation and the influence of artificial intelligence, emphasising leadership that creates safe, innovative, and collaborative environments.
 - **Special people**: A chapter dedicated to those who made a profound impact. Colleagues and friends such as Chuck, Rui, Robert, and Mathew are celebrated for their support, partnership, and mentorship. Their presence strengthened the author’s growth and contributed to key moments of learning, stability, and community throughout the career.
 - **Leaders in Action**: Reminders of leadership in motion and its influence on my journey. Mentors including Kühne, Boom-Boom, Brian, Hans, Roger, Wilfried, Charles, Ralf, James, Margie, Jeff, Bijan, Brian H, Melissa, Andre, and Marius provided lessons in humility, resilience, trust, and collaboration. Their guidance shaped a leadership style built on empathy, responsibility, and service to others.
 - **Practical Wisdom**: An attempt to share actionable insights with my younger self. Encourages resilience, continuous learning, and the smart use of tools such as artificial intelligence. Key values include humility, collaboration, passion, and placing people above processes. Maintaining balance, delivering meaningful value, and adapting to change remain essential for long-term success and healthy leadership.
