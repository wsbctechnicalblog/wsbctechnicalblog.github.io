Summary: As a team we want to create an empathetic, safe, and vibrant ecosystem

With our Common Engineering team we have a noble vision to _"Enable and empower engineering to work together with shared and efficient processes, products, and promote a healthy DevOps mindset, to continuously deliver value to our organization and end-users."_

As we prepare for the the countdown to launch our mission methods, we are taking the opportunity to inspect and adapt ourselves to create an **empathetic**, **safe**, and **vibrant** team, to continuously look for opportunities to **innovate** and reduce **waste**, and to contribute to a **common language.**

In this post we are sharing our dream team working agreement poster, which sets team expectations, lays out ways to collaborate, and establishes an atmosphere that encourages failure.
