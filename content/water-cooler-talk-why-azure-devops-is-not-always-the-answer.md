Summary: Yes, I LOVE Azure DevOps, but it is not the answer to the universe.

[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/) is a software as a service (SaaS) product that **empowers** you to plan smarter, collaborate better, and ship faster. Integrated with [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=popular) services, Azure DevOps is geared for software development.

The latter, **geared for software developnment**, is key. Recently when I received a request to create a new Azure DevOps project, with special requests for GANTT extensions and serious push back on the [Delivery Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/plans/track-dependencies?view=azure-devops) and [Kanban Boared](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/boards/kanban-quickstart?view=azure-devops) features.

I wanted to know more ... a lot more. It quickly became apparent that the team were only interested in the Azure Boards service, the CMMI process, and were only going to use Azure DevOps to track a waterfall project.

After considering the **license** cost, required **training**, and especially the **support of extensions** not used by the rest of the organization, I recommended the user to consider [Microsoft Project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/project/compare-microsoft-project-management-software) instead.

It is important to use the right tool for the right job!
