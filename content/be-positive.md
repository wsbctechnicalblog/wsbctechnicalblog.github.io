Summary: "Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the sum of all vectors." - Elon Musk

After observing a lot of technical leads and mentors over the past 35+ years of bits & bytes adventures, as well as observing those they influence, I have compiled my short list of top and least effective qualities. Take it with a pinch of salt, read between the lines, and remember it is my list - my views.

# Inspiration and leadership is based on a pull, not push model

When you approach the world with a "my way or the highway" mindset, directing, inspecting, monitoring, supervising, and in extreme cases micro managing your operating at the least effective level of leadership. Some common leadership anti-pattern signs:

- **Questioning everything** - there is a fine line (tone) between being curious and questioning.
- **Dominating discussions** - not allowing your team to self-manage and have vibrant discussions.
- **Micro managing** - double and triple checking everything, creating a **low-trust** environment.
- **Directing from the back** - I witnessed true leadership in the early 80's when I served with a humble, but phenomenal leader. He was always part of the team, usually leading at the front, at time encouraging everyone at the back carrying extra equipment on long marches, and empowering everyone in our unit to make decisions and lead.

I realized that you cannot **push** as a leader, you have to **lead** and **encourage** to pursue a common **goal**.

# Challenge your ecosystem

Last, but not least, you have to challenge your ecosystem to continuously learn, innovate, learn from failures, innovate, strive to be a tiny bit better tomorrow. Our common engineering ecosystem uses a platter of motivators and challenges to keep our engineers on their toes. 

For example, we just challenged our engineers with the following:
