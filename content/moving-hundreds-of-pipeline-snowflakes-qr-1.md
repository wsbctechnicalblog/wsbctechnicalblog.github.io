The quick reference poster introduces:

- Basic concepts for **Parameters**, **Variables**, **Triggers**, **Resources**, and **Templates**, as used in our generic blueprint-based pipelines. See [YAML Schema](https://aka.ms/yaml) for details.
- In the centre of the poster, our single-job, multiple-steps **generic blueprint**. See [Part 6: Pipelines - Gotcha! The generic blueprint-based YAML pipeline simplicity](/yaml-pipelines-part6.html) for details.
- On the right-hand side, our **bootstrap template**. See [Part 3: Pipelines - Basic building blocks as templates and sprinkling on telemetry](/yaml-pipelines-part3.html) for details.
