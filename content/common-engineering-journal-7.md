Summary: Exploring innovative automation strategies to empower engineers with the right tools and support, exactly when they need them.

**I have a dream!** A software development lifecycle (SDLC) that encourages innovation, continuous experimentation, and quality excellence can delight end-users. Automation frees engineers from repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on meaningful work. This leads to cost-effective solutions, frequent feature updates, and a better work-life balance.

![WHY](../images/common-engineering-journal-7-0.png) 

We aim to blend technical excellence with human-centric goals:

- **Automation** to increase efficiency and free engineers for creative tasks.
- **Holistic Outcomes** that move us beyond speed and cost to user satisfaction and adaptability.
- **Continuous Innovation** to evolve with industry, policies, and user expectations.
- **Balance Personal and Business Impacts** to ensure well-being and operational success.
- **Adaptability and Resilience** by staying agile with continuous delivery.

The goal is to enhance **operational efficiency** and create a sustainable, **fulfilling engineering environment**, making our organization a leader in innovation and employee satisfaction.

I would like to respectfully disagree and reference a slide, as above, I presented in 2018 regarding our successful transition of [75,000]( https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/moving-75000-microsofties-to-devops-with-visual-studio-team-services/98844997). It demonstrates a pull request that executed 71,283 unit tests in 6 minutes and 35 seconds with a 100% pass rate as part of the automated validation build - rapid feedback, while developing. This accomplishment underscores the potential of achieving such outcomes with an effective software development lifecycle, appropriate processes, products, and people.

# Doing it the hard way!

> ![Hard Way](../images/common-engineering-journal-7-1.png) 

In the traditional approach to software development, developers focus on writing new feature code. At a certain point, the team builds the code, deploys the release to one or more pre-installed environments, and hands it over to quality assurance (QA) testers. These testers then validate the software using a structured test plan comprised of test suites and cases.

Most of this testing was manual because QA testers possessed the specialized business knowledge and understanding of intricate dependencies necessary to validate the system. Consequently, they executed the same test plan repeatedly, cycle after cycle.

What stands out, as illustrated in the workflow, is that the building and deployment processes have been automated for yearsâ€”decades, in fact. After all, are you still manually compiling, linking, and copying files using a command prompt? Probably not.

![WHY](../images/common-engineering-journal-7-0.png) 

Why has build and deployment automation become standard, while manual QA testing persists? This paradox warrants reconsideration for greater efficiency and innovation.
