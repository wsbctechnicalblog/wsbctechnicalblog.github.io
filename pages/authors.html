    <h2>Alex Bunardzic</h2>
<p><img alt="Alex Bunardzic" src="/images/Alex-mug.jpg"></p>
<p>Alex has been doing software development since 1990. His professional passion is bringing <em>soft</em> into software. Which means software must be soft, maleable, pliable. That quality enables the flexibility of the business operations.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that software we are building is flexible, we must evolve it one step at a time. Each step (and the smaller that step is, the better) must get verified by automated testing. Early failures are welcome, because they are small and they force us to fix them right away. In the software engineering discipline, giant steps are foolish steps. It is more prudent to stay with small steps (many, many small steps) on our journey to deliver value to customer satisfaction.</p>

<h2>Kevin Schwantje</h2>
<p><img alt="Kevin Schwantje" src="/images/Kevin-mug.jpeg"></p>
<p>Kevin has been working in cybersecurity for the past nine years, attacking and defending everything from networks to virtual machines. In his current iteration, he’s a DevSecOps security engineer safeguarding web apps from today’s scary modern threat landscape. At WorkSafeBC, Kevin has found a passion for integrating security practices into every level of software development practices, from Agile principles all the way to Azure DevOps and CI/CD pipelines and processes. He believes in pushing left, purple teaming, favouring a human approach over spreadsheets and always saying “no”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The purpose and intent of DevSecOps, is to build on the mindset that ‘everyone is responsible for security’ with the goal of safely distributing security decisions at speed and scale to those who hold the highest level of context without sacrificing the safety required.” - Shannon Lietz</em></p>

<h2>Willy-Peter Schaub</h2>
<p><img alt="Willy-Peter Schaub" src="/images/willy-schaub.png"></p>
<p>Willy-Peter began his IT career in the early 1980s, during his electrical engineering studies, focusing on the BTOS/CTOS operating systems until he moved over to Microsoft technologies in the early ‘90s. Since then, his passion has been to investigate, research, and evangelize technology and best practises, striving for <em>simplicity</em> and <em>maintainability</em> in software engineering. Apart from sharing technology and transformation learnings in <a href="https://www.twitter.com/wpschaub">tweets</a>, blogs, <a href="https://www.opensource.com/user_articles/180826">articles</a>, and books such as <a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!AoTKFn7kQntwmahQJlHkxzgjlzQv4w">.NET Enterprise Solutions - Best Practises</a>, <a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!AoTKFn7kQntwmahS9OnZ20IB2aecYg">.NET Enterprise Solutions - Interoperability for the Connoisseur</a>, <a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!AoTKFn7kQntwmahRBJUVSZWpWXnDAg">Software Engineers on their way to Pluto</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Navigating-DevOps-Through-Waterfalls-Brent/dp/1999529103">Navigating DevOps Through Waterfalls</a>, his varied and extreme interests include scuba diving, cycling, science fiction, astronomy, and, most importantly, his family. </p>
